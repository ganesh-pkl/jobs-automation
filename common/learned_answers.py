"""
Remembers answers to screening questions you've typed in yourself before,
keyed by a normalized version of the question text, so you're never asked
the same question twice across runs.

Stored as plain JSON at learned_answers.json in the project root. Sensitive
answers such as DOB and identity numbers are never written here. The remaining
answers may still be personal, so keep this file private like profile.yaml.
